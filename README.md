# Bloc-Poc
Weather App with BLoC
## Description
Weather Flutter App with Bloc State Provider
The example is taken from https://dhruvnakum.xyz/flutter-bloc-a-complete-guide
Further explanation can be found there.
The Bloc Provider, though, was refactored in this POC to adapt to new flutter_bloc 8.0.1 version, in which the mapEventToState method in the Bloc Provider was replaced by the on&#60;Event&#62; ((event, emit) {...... emit(State)}
